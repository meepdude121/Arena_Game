Player.cs Restructure todo list

Step 1: Create UIManager.cs
    Refactor to energy value
    Add code:

    This also needs to change to UpdateEnergy because of the change in game mechanics

DONE

Step 2: clean up this mess:
    Rigidbody rb;
    [Range(1, 1000)]
    public float Speed;
    public float Health;
    public float maxHealth;
    float healthSliderValue = 1f;
    public Slider healthSlider;
    public TextMeshProUGUI healthText;
    public Weapon weapon;
    public bool InTransition = false;
    public Vector3 transitionPosition;
    private float b;
    private Vector3 a;

    Solution

        private Rigidbody Player_Rigidbody
        private float Player_Speed;

        private float Player_Energy;
        private float Player_EnergyCapacity;
    
Most other things should be stored in other scripts to clean up the code.

Step 3: Create separate script for camera. There is no input for the camera so it does not need to be in the Player.cs file

    Store camera centric variables in the script. Includes
        bool::InTransition
        Vector3::TransitionPosition

Step 4: Redo everything else
