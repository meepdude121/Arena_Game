# this is basically a preset dump that can be changed on the fly
# which allows for runtime random enemy generation
# and the ability to create funny little inventory assets easier

# to use do Resources.Load<T>(string Path); (returns type T if asset exists)
# this folder is the root directory so do not put "Resources/BlahBlah"
